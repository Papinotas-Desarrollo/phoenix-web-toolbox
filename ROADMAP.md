# Roadmap

This project was born of the need to reuse many components that we use on our react projects. We decided to make it public in an effort to, in the future, allow others to make use of some things that we built.

This document will give you some understanding on how this project will evolve.

## The alpha stage

This first stage will focus on building a set of components that we feel comfortable with. It will also be a phase when we'll try a lot of stuff so the project will probably change a lot

## The beta stage

As we continue to build up new components we'll focus on working in the documentation and explore better testing practices.

## The release build

When the alpha and beta stages are done we'll work on the first stable release.
